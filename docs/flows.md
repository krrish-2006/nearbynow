## Cart Flow

2. `placeOrderAction` fetches cart items for page revalidation.
3. Action validates the cart is not empty.
4. Action calls the `place_cart_cod_order` Postgres RPC.
5. RPC locks product rows, validates every item is active and in stock, creates the order, creates `PENDING` order items with their owning `shop_id`, decrements stock, and clears the cart atomically.
6. The cart may include products from multiple shops because fulfillment ownership and status live on each order item.
7. Action revalidates cart, marketplace, products, product detail pages, and orders.
8. Buyer is redirected to `/orders`.

3. `updateShopCityAction` validates the current seller, updates the seller's shop city through a repository helper, and revalidates the profile page.
4. The pickup location picker searches OpenStreetMap through the app's `/api/locations/search` route, or lets the seller click an exact pin on an embedded OpenStreetMap map.
5. `updatePickupLocationAction` stores the protected pickup address, coordinates, pickup window, and pickup instructions.
6. `/seller` redirects to `/seller/profile`.
7. `/seller/settings` redirects to `/seller/profile` for old links.

## Seller Order Status Flow

1. Seller opens `/seller/orders`.
2. Seller sees metric cards for cart quantity, wishlisted products, and completed orders.
3. Seller sees order items for products from their own shop.
4. Seller status changes validate against the shared order status list.
5. Sellers can choose Pending, Confirmed, Completed, or Cancelled.
6. The database allows sellers to update only `order_items.status` for their own shop-owned line items.
7. Status updates set lifecycle timestamps and sync the parent order/COD payment status.
8. Confirmed/completed buyer order items include pickup address, map link, pickup window, and pickup instructions from the same protected pickup location data.
9. The buyer orders page reads the same item and order status data, so seller status changes show there too.
10. One seller cannot update another seller's items in the same multi-shop order.

2. App reads the current user through Supabase server/client helpers.
